# How-to: [#1 (comment)](https://github.com/IlliumIv/Queuete-s-ExileApi-Plugins/issues/1#issuecomment-897152824)

This repo is a mirror of https://github.com/IlliumIv/ExileApi. It is an attempt to make all PoeHelper's plugins work with both public and private ExileApi. I have not much time to play and the current number of plugins is about 60 so I physically can not test all plugins - focussed mostly on no-problems build. I appreciate any reported issues and pull-requests and I've plans to review them all.
